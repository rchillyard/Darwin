# Darwin
Darwin framework (Scala) for Genetic Algorithms (based on Darwin at SourceForge).

This is a general purpose framework for performing evolutionary computation (via so-called genetic algorithms).
The types defined in the framework are as generic as possible, thus allowing the
programmer to extend these types for their own purposes.
Generally speaking, these types which may be extended are in the form of traits.

## Dependencies

Darwin depends on LaScala, a library of useful functional programming classes.
LaScala is not currently hosted in any central repository so you will have to download artifacts from the LaScala site.
